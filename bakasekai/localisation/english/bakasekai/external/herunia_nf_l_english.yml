  HRE_focus_to_doctrine_1_desc:0 "The first one is Skadi from Arknights. A muscle-brained, white-haired, big-breasted, red-eyed orca woman. Her voice is calm. I thought she was a calm and composed type because of her cool appearance, but the gap with her muscle-brained personality is good. Reflecting her muscle-brained nature, she boasts top-class attack power in the game. It's also great that she comes from the Abyssal faction, which is shrouded in mystery and has a Cthulhu-like feel to it. I love mysterious characters. Her weapon is a greatsword that is almost the same length as her height."

The sword itself seems to be specially made, so does it have some special connection to her heart? Or is it just a metaphorical expression? It's great for fueling my imagination. And after all, her big breasts are the best! It's my fetish, so all my favorite characters have big breasts. Skadi is cute, cool, the strongest, a god."

She has a cool weapon like a gunlance from Monster Hunter (without a shield), and she's super cool. Since she's a professional soldier, all her in-combat lines are cool. But her off-duty lines have a relaxed dialect feel, which is a great gap. Handsome. One of the few characters in Arknights who wears a uniform when everyone else is wearing whatever they want."

Exposed navel, exposed upper breasts, sheer skirt - is the illustrator trying to kill me!? Even in her original uniform, she seemed to have decent breasts, but in the race queen outfit, perhaps because of the thin clothes, her chest is emphasized and looks huge, and there's a zipper on her chest, what on earth is that for!?!?"

(Pressure) With those breasts, it's impossible for her to be 15... she's that big-breasted. In fan art illustrations, she tends to be drawn even bigger.

Her voice sounds like a cheerful girl, it's easy to listen to and not tiring. And you know, since it's a voice synthesis software, you can make Akari-chan say whatever you want. Game characters have fixed lines, but with Akari-chan, anything is possible. Is she a god??? The price may seem high at first glance, but it's cheaper than gacha in social games!"

It's an adult game, so don't search for it if you're under 18!!! A blonde, big-breasted, chunibyo high school girl. In chunibyo mode, she's handsome, but her true self is clumsy and cute.

There's a scene where she leans on the main character in this outfit with an upward glance, and it's so destructive I could die.

A cool, beautiful university student. Her voice is also calm. Her 'ha?' voice is irresistible. The game has a voice bookmark function, and it's no exaggeration to say that it's filled with her insults (exaggeration).
