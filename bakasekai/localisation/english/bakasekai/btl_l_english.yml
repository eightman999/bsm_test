BTL_GATHERING_STORM_DESC: "The Battle Three Kingdoms is a resource-rich region located at a strategic point in Eastern Europe. With abundant mineral resources, fertile farmland, and a long military tradition, multiple political forces are competing for hegemony in this region. Each force has built a complex relationship of sometimes confronting and sometimes cooperating with each other. The calm before the storm. As the shadow of war approaches, we must consider our next move."
