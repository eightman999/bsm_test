# Fallen Empires

This module introduces ancient empires with overwhelming strength that remain dormant unless provoked.

- At game start, NPL, MON, SPL and '_' begin as fallen empires.
- Four ethos types exist: machine intelligences, fanatic xenophobes, isolationists and watchers.
- Fallen empires rarely expand but may send gifts to nearby nations.
- Gifts can grant resources, technology, equipment or the special idea "Ancestor Data Banks".
- Refusing a gift harms relations while acceptance improves them.
- Future updates will expand awakening wars between fallen empires.
- Dormant empires start with vast off-map industry and every standard technology unlocked but cannot declare wars until they awaken.
