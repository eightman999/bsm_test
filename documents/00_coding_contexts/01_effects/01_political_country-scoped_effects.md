The autonomy states are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/autonomous_states/*.txt`. | 1.3 |

If used with a trade opinion_modifier the behaviour is reversed, meaning that the target gains the trade opinion towards the current scope. Opinion modifiers are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion_modifiers/*.txt`. | 1.0 |
| `remove_opinion_modifier` | `target = <country>`<br>The target country.<br>`modifier = <modifier>`<br>The opinion modifier to remove. | ```remove_opinion_modifier = {<br>    target = GER<br>    modifier = faction_traitor<br>}``` | The current scope loses the specified opinion modifier towards the target scope. | Opinion modifiers are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion_modifiers/*.txt`. | 1.0 |

Opinion modifiers are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/opinion_modifiers/*.txt`. | 1.0 |
| `add_relation_modifier` | `target = <country>`<br>The target country.<br>`modifier = <modifier>`<br>The relation modifier to add. | ```add_relation_modifier = {<br>    target = SWE<br>    modifier = HUN_dynastic_ties_license<br>}``` | The current scope gains the specified relation modifier towards the target scope. | Relation modifiers are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/modifiers/*.txt` files, used to apply a targeted modifier with a non-static target. To change the diplomatic opinion of a country, see `add_opinion_modifier`. | 1.4 |
| `remove_relation_modifier` | `target = <country>`<br>The target country.<br>`modifier = <modifier>`<br>The relation modifier to remove. | ```remove_relation_modifier = {<br>    target = SWE<br>    modifier = HUN_dynastic_ties_license<br>}``` | The current scope loses the specified relation modifier for towards the target scope. | Relation modifiers are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/modifiers/*.txt`, used to apply a targeted modifier with a non-static target. To change the diplomatic opinion of a country, see `remove_opinion_modifier`. | 1.4 |

| `recall_volunteers_from` | `<tag>`<br>The target country. | `recall_volunteers_from = SPR` | Recalls volunteers sent to the specified country back to the current country. | | 1.9 |
| `set_occupation_law` | `<law ID>`<br>The new occupation law enacted by the previous scope or `default_law`. | ```USA = {<br>  GER = {<br>    set_occupation_law = foreign_civilian_oversight<br>  }<br>}<br># Changes USA's occupation law for GER.<br>USA = {<br>  USA = {<br>    set_occupation_law = default_law<br>  }<br>}<br># Changes the USA's default occupation law to the default.``` | Sets the occupation law of the country. | PREV will be the country for whom the occupation law will be changed. If PREV is not a country, nothing changes. If PREV is the same country, changes the default occupation law. If PREV is different, `default_law` resets the country-specific law to the global default, otherwise it resets the default law to the occupation law with `starting_law = yes` in definition. Can also be used in state scope. | 1.12 |
| `set_occupation_law_where_available` | `<law ID>`<br>The new occupation law enacted by the previous scope or `default_law`. | ```USA = {<br>  GER = {<br>    set_occupation_law_where_available = foreign_civilian_oversight<br>  }<br>}<br># Changes USA's occupation law for GER where possible.<br>USA = {<br>  USA = {<br>    set_occupation_law_where_available = default_law<br>  }<br>}<br># Changes the USA's default occupation law to the default where possible.``` | Sets the occupation law of the country. | Identical to `set_occupation_law`, except if the law is impossible to set, tries again at every smaller sub-set: if default is impossible, tries every single individual occupied country; if the country's law is impossible to change, tries every single state within the country. | 1.12 |
| `send_embargo` | `<tag>`<br>The target country. | `send_embargo = ITA` | Embargos the target country. | | 1.12 |
| `break_embargo` | `<tag>`<br>The target country. | `break_embargo = ITA` | Stops embargoing the target country. | As of 1.14.7, this effect ignores country scoping and always applies to the ROOT, instead the `diplomatic_relation` effect can be used to break the embargoes of other countries. | 1.12 |
| `give_market_access` | `<tag>`<br>The target country. | `give_market_access = ITA` | Opens market access between the two countries. | | 1.13 |

|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `puppet` | `<country>`<br>The target country.<br>OR<br>`target = <country>`<br>The target country.<br>`end_wars = <bool>`<br>Whether the target country will peace out in all of its non-civil wars it's participating in. Defaults to true.<br>`end_civil_wars = <bool>`<br>Whether the target country will peace out in all of its civil wars it's participating in. Defaults to true. | ```puppet = GER<br><br>puppet = {<br>    target = ITA<br>    end_wars = no<br>}``` | Makes the specified country a subject of the current scope. | The autonomous state picked is one which contains `default = yes` and where `allowed = { ... }` is fulfilled within the `/Hearts of Iron IV/commmon/autonomous_states/` definition, rather than necessarily being autonomy_puppet. Results in a crash-to-desktop if the game is unable to find any such autonomous states. | 1.0 |
| `end_puppet` | `<country>`<br>The target country. | `end_puppet = GER` | Removes the subject status between the target and the current scope. | Must be used within the overlord's scope. | 1.0 |
| `add_autonomy_ratio` | `value = <float>`<br>The freedom score to add.<br>`localization = <string>`<br>The localization key for the modifier. | ```add_autonomy_ratio = {<br>    value = 0.1<br>    localization = AST_adopt_westminster<br>}``` | Adds a freedom score ratio modifier to the current scope. | Used in the subject's scope. | 1.3 |
| `add_autonomy_score` | `value = <float>`<br>The freedom score to add.<br>`localization = <string>`<br>The localization key for the modifier. | ```add_autonomy_score = {<br>    value = 10<br>    localization = EXAMPLE<br>}``` | Adds an exact freedom score modifier to the current scope. | Used in the subject's scope. | 1.3 |
| `set_autonomy` | `target = <country> / <variable>`<br>The subject country.<br>`autonomous_state = <type>`<br>The type of autonomy state to set.<br>`freedom_level = <float>`<br>The new freedom level value. Optional.<br>`end_wars = <yes/no>`<br>Will end any wars the subject is involved in.<br>`end_civil_wars = <yes/no>`<br>Will end any civil wars the subject is subject to. | ```set_autonomy = {<br>    target = AST<br>    autonomous_state = autonomy_free<br>    end_wars = no<br>    end_civil_wars = no<br>}``` | Sets the autonomy level for the specified country, including independence. | The `autonomy_free` state will free the subject, however this effect has to be executed within the scope of the target country's current overlord for this to have effect. The autonomy states are found in `/Hearts of Iron IV/common/autonomous_states/*.txt` files. Although `end_wars` is an optional argument defaulting to no, omitting it results in the country's occupied states returning to its control, stranding enemy units. | 1.3 |

Can only be used if at war with the target. A `score_factor` of 0.0 is equivalent to a whitepeace. `winner_scope` and `loser_scope` have the following possible values:<br>ALL: all countries at war with the other side.<br>FACTION: all countries in the same faction as the current scope or under its overlordship.<br>LIMITED_FACTION: includes faction members if and only if the country is a faction leader, and includes subjects of the country.<br>LIMITED: includes only subjects of the country. | 1.12 |
